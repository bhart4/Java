# Publish Subscribe System

This project is about the specification, design and implementation of a simple publish subscribe system. 

A publish-subscribe system (pub/sub system) is a system composed of publishers and subscribers. The publishers generate events and post them on a shared medium (i.e. the channel), where many subscribers have access to. The publishers do not know, and do not need to know, who the subscribers in the system are, and who consumes the published events. Publishers just generate events that are sent to a channel. For our project, the channel, on which a publisher publishes its messages is determined by the strategy the publisher is associated with. We consider that events have a type. Similarly, subscribers subscribe to specific channels, in order to get access to the events posted in those channels. A channel knows its subscribers and notifies them when a new event is posted in the channel. Upon reception of an event, subscribers may perform an action, depending on their state. A good description of the pub/sub architectural style can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern, and https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/appdev.920/a96590/adg15pub.htm
